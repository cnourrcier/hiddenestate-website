                "We love a good pink house, but a rosy-hued home that once
                belonged to one of Hollywood's dreamiest actors makes us
                especially giddy. It's like the real-estate equivalent of a
                strapping gentleman in a pink polo shirt â€” oddly, it just works.

                <span>Clark Gable</span> and actress <span>Carole Lombard</span>{" "}
                once called this Spanish Colonial in Palm Springs their home.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it's rife with perplexing famous-people details, like half a
                dozen bathrooms, a saltwater pool, and a guest house cutely
                called a <i>'casita'</i>. But, exposed wooden beams, intricate
                tilework, and a master bedroom with outdoor access make this
                house a timeless classic (much like Gable himself)."
