                        When the big story became World War II, Doris Fleeson
                        was on the job as a foreign correspondent. In 1940 she
                        toured with Sumner Welles as he visited European
                        capitals on a fact-finding mission for the president.

                    <li className="list-item">
                        She was one of the first American women on the beach
                        after D-Day in 1944. She also accompanied the first
                        contingent of WACs to England in 1943 and covered the
                        western front from Salerno t o Scotland.
                    </li>
                    <li className="list-item">
                        She was under fire in Italy with Gen. Mark Clark's Army
                        and sat out the robot-bombing in England while waiting
                        for D-Day.

                <p>
                    Fleeson said to Chicago Times in 1944: “In Italy I went
                    ashore in an amphibious duck with an Army evacuation nurses
                    unit and landed right on the beach. I have never seen such
                    heroism as those girls showed. They would trudge up to the
                    lines under fire to attend the wounded.”
