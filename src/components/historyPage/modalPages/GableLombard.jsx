            Hidden Gable Estate, commissioned by Agnes Swobdi, is a product of the roaring 20's.  It was a time of great wealth creation, women's liberation and revealing fashions aka “flappers”.  It was also the golden age of Hollywood dominated by Clark Gable “King of Hollywood”.

            Silent films became popular in the US at the beginning of the 20th century around the same time Swobdi had her first Millinery store (1901) in Los Angeles.  She evolved (with Hollywood) into high end couture to the silent movie stars.  Most likely provided fashions for yet to be discovered silent movie actress Carol Lombard who was later known as one of greatest actresses of Classic Hollywood Cinema.  Swobdi's parties in Los Angeles were legendary and certainly included rising stars and Hollywood's elite.

            Clark Gable and Carol Lombard both got their starts as extras and supporting roles in silent films produced in the 20's (Clark Gable's in 1924 and Carol Lombard's in 1921).  Stars of the silent film era like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Harold Lloyd faded into obscurity in the 1930s after the advent of the talkies but not Clark Gable and Carol Lombard.

            Gable and Lombard began a secret relationship that became public once his divorce from Langham was finalized in 1938.  Gable and Lombard (his true love) married soon after on March 12, 1939.

            Their primary residence (purchased just before they married) was a 20-acre ranch in the city of Encino, less than 15 miles from the recording studios in Culver City.  However, they had a second home in Palm Springs (Hidden Gable Estate) until Carol Lombard's untimely death in 1942.  This was their most private desert hideaway.

            Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and devastated by his loss, joined the United States Army Air Forces. Lombard had asked him to do that numerous times after the United States had entered World War II.  After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit attached to a B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself.

            In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named in Carol Lombard's honor would be launched.   Gable attended the launch of the SS Carole Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.

            One of the main attractions of Palm Springs and the greater Coachella Valley was the dry climate. Daily life was leisurely and centered around pools and golf courses. There were many good restaurants, but residents tended to entertain casually in their homes. It was a perfect place for the film elite to go when they were not making a movie, to relax and be “just normal folk”. Yet, near enough to the filming studios for a quick return if needed.  It offered as neighbors some of the Gables' good friends—William Powell, Kirk Douglas, William Holden, actress Brenda Marshall; Cary Grant; and Zeppo and Barbara Marx (who would later marry Frank Sinatra).

            In 1955, Clark Gable married Kay Spreckels.  Clark and Kay chose as their home a new development in the community of Bermuda Dunes, near Palm Springs, which abutted the private one-hundred-sixty-acre Bermuda Dunes Golf Club.
