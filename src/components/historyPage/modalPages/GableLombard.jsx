                Hidden Estate, commissioned by Agnes Swobdi, is a product of the
                roaring 20's. It was a time of great wealth creation, women's
                liberation and revealing fashions aka “flappers”. It was also
                the golden age of Hollywood dominated by Clark Gable “King of
                Hollywood”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Silent films became popular in the US at the beginning of the
                20th century around the same time Swobdi had her first Millinery
                store (1901) in Los Angeles. She evolved (with Hollywood) into
                high end couturière to the silent movie stars. Most likely
                provided fashions for yet to be discovered silent movie actress
                Carol Lombard who was later known as one of greatest actresses
                of Classic Hollywood Cinema. Swobdi's parties in Los Angeles
                were legendary and certainly included rising stars and
                Hollywood's elite.

                Clark Gable and Carol Lombard both got their starts as extras
                and supporting roles in silent films produced in the 20's (Clark
                Gable's in 1924 and Carol Lombard's in 1921). Stars of the
                silent film era like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and
                Harold Lloyd faded into obscurity in the 1930s after the advent
                of the talkies but not Clark Gable and Carol Lombard.

                Gable and Lombard began a secret relationship that became public
                once his divorce from Langham was finalized in 1938. Gable and
                Lombard (his true love) married soon after on March 12, 1939.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their primary residence (purchased just before they married) was
                a 20-acre ranch in the city of Encino, less than 15 miles from
                the recording studios in Culver City. However, they had a second
                home in Palm Springs (Hidden Estate) until Carol Lombard's
                untimely death in 1942. This was their most private desert
                hideaway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and
                devastated by his loss, joined the United States Army Air
                Forces. Lombard had asked him to do that numerous times after
                the United States had entered World War II. After officer
                training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit attached to
                a B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat,
                flying five missions himself.

                Doris Fleeson, a future resident of Hidden Estate, meet Clark
                Gable in London. You can see the article she wrote about Gable
                in her section of the property's history.

                In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission
                announced that a Liberty ship named in Carol Lombard's honor
                would be launched. Gable attended the launch of the SS Carole
                Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of
                Lombard's war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing
                hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and
                returning them to safety.

                One of the main attractions of Palm Springs and the greater
                Coachella Valley was the dry climate. Daily life was leisurely
                and centered around pools and golf courses. There were many good
                restaurants, but residents tended to entertain casually in their
                homes. It was a perfect place for the film elite to go when they
                were not making a movie, to relax and be “just normal folk”.
                Yet, near enough to the filming studios for a quick return if
                needed. It offered as neighbors some of the Gables' good
                friends—William Powell, Kirk Douglas, William Holden, actress
                Brenda Marshall; Cary Grant; and Zeppo and Barbara Marx (who
                would later marry Frank Sinatra).

                In 1955, Clark Gable married Kay Spreckels. Clark and Kay chose
                as their home a new development in the community of Bermuda
                Dunes, near Palm Springs, which abutted the private
                one-hundred-sixty-acre Bermuda Dunes Golf Club.
