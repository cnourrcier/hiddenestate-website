                        Springs offered a convenient escape from the hustle and
                        bustle of Hollywood. It provided a serene retreat where
                        stars could unwind and enjoy a more private lifestyle
                        within the tranquility of the desert.

                    "We love a good pink house, but a rosy-hued home that once
                    belonged to one of Hollywood's dreamiest actors makes us
                    especially giddy. It's like the real-estate equivalent of a
                    strapping gentleman in a pink polo shirt — oddly, it just
                    works.

                    And it's rife with perplexing famous-people details, like
                    half a dozen bathrooms, a saltwater pool, and a guest house
                    cutely called a <i>'casita'</i>. But, exposed wooden beams,
                    intricate tilework, and a master bedroom with outdoor access
                    make this house a timeless classic (much like Gable
                    himself)."
